### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am a robotics researcher at the University of Edinburgh focussing on Robot Learning. I am associated with the [Robust Autonomy Decisions](https://rad.inf.ed.ac.uk/) group. I am also eager to get started on cool open source projects. If you have anything in mind do drop a message. Cheers!
